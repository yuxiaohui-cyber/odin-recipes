    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>

        <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix</li>

        <li>2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons white distilled vinegar</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons ground oregano</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon white sugar</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

        <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>

        <li>8 taco shells, warmed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step</h3>
    <ol>
        <h4>Step1</h4>
        <li>Mix water and taco seasoning in a large bowl. Add tomato sauce, vinegar, garlic, oregano, cumin, and sugar; mix well.</li>        
        <h4>Step2</h4>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Add tomato sauce mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)</li>
        <h4>Step3</h4>
        <li>Remove chicken breasts from the pan and shred meat with 2 forks when cool enough to handle. Return shredded chicken to the pan with the tomato sauce. Cook and stir until chicken is coated with sauce and sauce reduces a bit, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <h4>Step4</h4>
        <li>Transfer chicken and sauce to a serving bowl and spoon onto taco shells.</li>    
    </ol>
